- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I found Inheritance to be very interesting. In a way, I found it made my programming almost a little easier. For instance, I didn't have to write new code each time I wanted to make a new building. Instead, I could just call on the Building parent class to help with that. I'm not entirely sure I completely understand all of Inheritance, but I was at least apply to apply it to an extent!

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
* Reading through the README in its entirety first always = **
* Jotting down brief notes while getting the project overview in class helped me find my footing
* Writing down ideas outside of code on paper
