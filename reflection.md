- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I found Inheritance to be very interesting. In a way, it made my programming significantly easier because I didn't have to write as much and could just call on one singular parent to do all of the work. I'm curious to see how else it will be applied! 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Reading through the README in its entirety is the first thing you should always do. It helps to understand the entire project instead of coding as you read through the file. Also, jotting down brief notes while getting the project overview in class helped me find my footing. It's useful to have little notes throughout my code on where I should start with my code.
